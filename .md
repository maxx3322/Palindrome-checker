 //Our goal for solving this problem is tidying up the string passed in, and checking whether it is in fact a palindrome.

/*If you are unsure of what a palindrome is, it is a word or phrase that when reversed spells 
the same thing forwards or backwards. A simple example is mom, when you reverse the letters, 
it spells the same thing! Another example of a palindrome is race car. When 
we take out anything that is not a character it becomes racecar which is the same spelled forwards or backwards!*/
//Once we have determined whether it is a palindrome or not we want to return either true or false based on our findings.
 
 //this solution performs at minimum 7x better, at maximum infinitely better.
    //read the explanation for the reason why. I just failed this in an interview.
    function palindrome(str) {
      //assign a front and a back pointer
      let front = 0
      let back = str.length - 1

      //back and front pointers won't always meet in the middle, so use (back > front)
      while (back > front) {
        //increments front pointer if current character doesn't meet criteria
        if ( str[front].match(/[\W_]/) ) {
          front++
          continue
        }
        //decrements back pointer if current character doesn't meet criteria
        if ( str[back].match(/[\W_]/) ) {
          back--
          continue
        }
        //finally does the comparison on the current character
        if ( str[front].toLowerCase() !== str[back].toLowerCase() ) return false
        front++
        back--
      }

      //if the whole string has been compared without returning false, it's a palindrome!
      return true
